## Handy Bash Scripts

I use this repo as a collection of bash scripts I find myself wanting to download frequently.

#### arp.sh
Easily find and SSH into a Raspberry Pi when I connect via Ethernet

#### setup.sh
Easily download dotfiles (`.vimrc`, `.bashrc`, etc) to new machines

#### ssh-into-aws.sh
Easily boot up various AWS instances, grab the IP, SSH in using my private key, reocrd the time spent on the instance, and automatically shut down when I exit the SSH session

#### god.sh
Easily create a new bash script using a template

Also, an old collection of bash scripts created while working through http://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/ and http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/
